.

The following are the costs of the first , in order:

Start at  units cost, reduce that by  units each iteration until reaching a minimum possible price, . Starting with  units of currency in your Mist wallet, you can buy 5 games: .

Function Description

Complete the howManyGames function in the editor below.

howManyGames has the following parameters:

int p: the price of the first game
int d: the discount from the previous game price
int m: the minimum cost of a game
int s: the starting budget
Input Format

The first and only line of input contains four space-separated integers , ,  and .

Constraints

Sample Input 0

20 3 6 80
Sample Output 0

6
Explanation 0

Assumptions other than starting funds, , match the example in the problem statement. With a budget of , you can buy  games at a cost of . A  game for an additional  units exceeds the budget.

Sample Input 1

20 3 6 85
Sample Output 1

7
Explanation 1

This is the same as the previous case, except this time the starting budget  units of currency. This time, you can buy  games since they cost . An additional game at  units will exceed the budget.
